# Kapowarr React

> [!NOTE]
> This fork was made to add download support from Libgen+.
> It now also sports a frontend built with React that is based on Sonarr's frontend with more modern technology.
>
> - Because I am a NixOS user, I decided to make this a hard fork to keep the
    project more in line with what is expected from a python program while putting
    aside backwards compatibility.
> - I've also formatted the code to my preferences to facilitate further development.
> - I will still do my best to keep up to date with upstream, but if you start using
    this fork, you might not be able go back to upstream since I've changed some things
    in the database.
> - Currently at https://github.com/Casvt/Kapowarr/commit/3d15fed2afc8a8e12ae9d557df2da5d3fd926a66

Kapowarr React is a software to build and manage a comic book library, fitting in
the *arr suite of software.

Kapowarr React allows you to build a digital library of comics. You can add volumes,
map them to a folder and start managing! Download, rename, move and convert
issues of the volume (including TPB's, One Shots, Hard Covers, and more). The
whole process is automated and can be customised in the settings.

## Features

- Import your current library right into Kapowarr React
- Get loads of metadata about the volumes and issues in your library
- Run a "Search Monitored" to download whole volumes with one click
- Or use "Manual Search" to decide yourself what to download
- Support for downloading directly from Libgen+ and GetComics, or via MediaFire,
  Mega and many other services
- Downloaded files automatically get moved wherever you want and renamed in the
  format you desire
